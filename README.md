# Resource  Production Policy

Snapshots are taken throughout the week to check the listed and unlisted NFTs. The NFTs which are consistently unlisted have resources added in their wallets. At the end of the week, the incremented resources are reflected in the wallets.

**Planets** - For calculating the resource production of planets, each tier of planet is assigned a particular number of continents with their resource production equal to the resource production mentioned in the metadata of the planets. 

* **Tier A** - Each planet has 60 continents on it, 15 of each resource. 
* **Tier B** - Each planet has 40 continents on it, 10 of each resource.
* **Tier C** - Each planet has 20 continents on it, 5 of each resource

**Each planet earns a 5% tax from the resource production of each continent on it** 

**Continents** - For calculating resource production of planets, the metadata value is taken and the corresponding resource is added in the wallet at the end of the week.

**Floating Continents** - Each floating continent produces resources equal to their metadata value and don't give any taxes to their host planets.
