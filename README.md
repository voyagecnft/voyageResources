# Resource  Production Policy

Snapshots are taken throughout the week to check the listed and unlisted NFTs. The NFTs which are consistently unlisted have resources added in their wallets. At the end of the week, the incremented resources are reflected in the wallets.

**Planets** - For calculating the resource production of planets, each tier of planet is assigned a particular number of continents with their resource production equal to the resource production mentioned in the metadata of the planets. 

* **Tier A** - Each planet has 60 continents on it, 15 of each resource. 
* **Tier B** - Each planet has 40 continents on it, 10 of each resource.
* **Tier C** - Each planet has 20 continents on it, 5 of each resource

**Each planet earns a 5% tax from the resource production of each continent on it** 

**Continents** - For calculating resource production of planets, the metadata value is taken and the corresponding resource is added in the wallet at the end of the week. **The floor value of the resources is provided after paying 5% tax to the host planet.**

**Floating Continents** - Each floating continent produces the dominant resource of its host planet. The resource production is equal to two continents on the planet producing the dominant resource. Owners of floating continents do not have to pay any tax to the host planets.

   
**Resource Multipliers**

**Planet** - If a particular wallet holds sister planets of a particular sister group, there is a resource multiplier for all the planets inside that wallet belonging to that sister group. The floor value of the obtained resources is provided after applying the resource boost.
    
|Planets held|Resource Boost|
|------------|--------------|
|2 or more |1.3x for each planet|
|4 or more |1.5x for each planet|
|7 or more |1.8x for each planet|
|10 or more |2x for each planet|
|13 or more |2.5x for each planet|

**Completing a sister cluster upgrades the resource boost to the next tier (if a higher resource boost exists)**
